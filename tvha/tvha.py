class VariationalHamiltonianAnsatz(BlueprintCircuit):
    """Implements truncated Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz (tVHA).

    Implements the Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz (VHA) as well as its variation, the
    truncated Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz (tVHA).

    VHA consists of alternating layers of Fock operator (known ground state Hamiltonian) and
    full Hamiltonian.
    In this implementation, the full Hamiltonian is split into one-body terms, Coulombic two-body
    terms, and the remaining non-Coulomb two-body terms.
    Truncation in tVHA is performed on the non-Coulomb two-body terms since their
    circuit representation consists of multiple CNOT gates and is thus the most problematic part
    on NISQ devices.

        Args:
            problem: The representation of the molecule as ElectronicStructureProblem
            mapper: maps fermionic operators to qubit operators.
            trotter_steps: Number of steps to discretize the adiabatic time evolution.
                In the limit of infinite disretization steps the adiabatic theorem guarantees
                to yield the ground state of the final Hamiltonian.
            threshold_gamma: Threshold for filtering terms in the Hamiltonian H_gamma
                for construction of the ansatz circuit.
                A threshold of 0.9 means that 90% are considered.
                The terms are sorted based on the coefficient value (or rather `abs(coeff_value)`)
                before applying the threshold.
                The terms are filtered such that terms are added until
                `threshold*sum(coeff_values)` is reached; due to the calculation method
                the final threshold might be (potentially significantly) larger than
                the initial threshold argument; for larger molecules, these deviations should
                become smaller due to the large number of terms in the Hamiltonian.
                If a threshold_gamma of 1 (i.e. 100%) is chosen, this resembles the VHA algorithm;
                any other threshold_gamma means that the tVHA algorithm is implemented.
            trotterization_order: Scheme to expand exponentiation of non-commuting operators;
                typically 1st order Trotterization exp(A+B)/approx exp(A)*exp(B) is sufficient.
                Increasing the number of Trotter steps is most likely more efficient
                to yield higher accuracy.
            name: Name of the block in the overall circuit.
            insert_barriers: Whether to insert barriers between different building blocks.
                Solely for visualization purposes.
